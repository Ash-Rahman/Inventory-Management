# Project
## Telesoft Inventory Management
This project is the Telesoft Invetory Management systems source code, created by Ashikur Rahman.

# Features
Features include, Adding and Updating items, Checking in/out items and displaying the history of all items.

# Authentication
For the project authentication I used firebase, a website storage and authentication solution.
The project only supports logging in with email or a google account.
If this was deployed inside the company I will not use firebase, but instead use Telesofts own user and datastorage solution.

# Running Instruction
1. Update `src/config/firebase.js` to your own projects config settings
2. Install your the latest project dependencies - `npm install` 
3. Run the project - `npm run start`

# More information
For more information see the documentation.md to get a breakdown of the projects life.

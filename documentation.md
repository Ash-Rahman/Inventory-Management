# Introduction
For this project I have created an Inventory Management system which will be used by Telesoft Technologies employees to organise inventory amongst all the engineering teams. I previously conducted interviews with employees to further understand the problems of inventory management within the company. From these interviews I found 4 problem areas.

  1.	Where is the equipment currently located?
  2.	Who is currently using the equipment?
  3.	How many of the item do we currently have?
  4.	Who has previously used that equipment?
  
I set out to create a web-application with the us which can address all 4 of these issues. I used the design thinking methodology to create this application and have done the Empathise, Define and Ideate steps in the previous assessment. Now I must complete the final two steps; Prototype and Testing. I adopted the Agile method and have adapted it for a small-scale individual project.

To complete the final two phases of the DT methodology I have separated the project into several sprints in which each one will implement a feature which will fix our 4 problem areas. In addition, I did a couple of other sprints at the end which were website styling, clean-up and deployment. For testing I conducted interviews with the same people interviewed in part 1. I allowed each employee to use the web application and asked for their feedback on each feature of the web application.

# Methodology
I combined design thinking and agile to deliver the product. I used agile to create sprints which are small milestones of the product such as, add dashboard page or allow exporting history of transactions. Stevens (2019) suggests breaking up the project into very small chunks which makes the task easier to complete and ensures that all requirements are met. Using this method also allows me to show a deliverable to the users very quickly and get feedback for each aspect of the UI. If I get some negative feedback, I will be required to rethink my design and implement the changes incrementally until the user is happy. Another reason I chose agile was because I use it daily at work, so I have a deep understanding of the methodology. Hollar (2006) suggests adapting agile into their own method of ‘cowboy’ development by making the feedback and iterations loops having a very fast turnaround time.

My agile development sprints are as follows:
  1.	Develop Dashboard
  2.	Allow user to add an item to the database / create a form
  3.	Allow a user to update an existing item in the database
  4.	Store history of item when change is made
  5.	Add history button to items, so the ui displays history of that item
  6.	Added item history PDF export
  7.	Allow user to search for items on dash
  8.	Allow user to check in/out items live on dash
  9.	General styling and making the UI look nicer

To organise all of this I used trello a free online agile organisation tool which allows me to place each sprint into its own post-it note. From there I can categorise these into work to be done, in progress, needs review and finished.

Most of my sprints only lasted about 1 to 2 days and I would get quick feedback from 1 or 2 users which would provide basic insights to the user experience and make minor adjustments to the experience. This is much easier done with a solo developer which can immediately get feedback and implement the changes themselves. For example, one major change I made was changing the dashboard to include all items instead of having a dedicated items page, as in my original design. Users said that instead of having to click to another page just to search for items, I should instead have the dashboard display all items and have the search bar there. This meant eliminating the ‘Latest activity’ window on my UI which users agreed was worth removing in favour of a streamlined experience. This change was easily made from talking directly with the end user and asking them their thought on what should change. This removed the ‘middleman’ which would have to write down and communicate the changes to the developer.  I think working as a solo developer on a small project is easier, because the developer has full understanding of the codebase and always knows what is done and needs to be done.

# Methods
To understand the effectiveness of my UI I conducted interviews which allowed me to get many different perspectives of my prototype. With this many perspectives I should be able to get varied feedback with great depth. After each major feature was added I conducted an interview with 2 people to get their feedback of the feature and would quickly implement the change they suggested very quickly. I also conducted interviews with all of the engineers once the prototype was complete.

Interviews are an excellent method to get information from a user, because you can have a direct conversation with them about their thought and feelings. Since I already know the users being interviewed, I can tailor each interview to the person, so I am able to squeeze more information out of them. For example, some employees will be very frank about the good and the bad parts of the UI and won’t need prompting. However, other employees will need direct prompting about their opinions.

The interviews I conducted during the development phase allowed me to get immediate feedback on what I had just developed. One example of this during my project is removing the Items page which some users said was redundant and only made the experience worse. Using the agile method allowed me to identify this early on so the issue could be resolved quickly, before the deadline.

At the end of the project I conducted a final interview which all users could give me feedback on what they thought of version 1 of the Inventory management system. Users thought that I had developed an adequate solution to all of their problems.

# Conclusion / Results
Overall, I think the solution adequately solves the 4 identified problems Telesoft Technologies was having with Inventory Management. Users stated its strengths are that it is very easy to use, does not have much fluff as there are only 2-3 pages that users will ever have to interact with. A user also stated that they really liked the fact that they can quickly log on and instantly see all their checked-out items at the top of the dashboard. Which with a click of a button they can check-in/out an item with no fuss. However, they did state that there is a short 2-3 second delay after they click check-in/out, which sometimes made them think they didn’t click the button. I don’t think this is a major issue but does detract from the user experience.

Something that I wish I had more time to work on was the visual aspect of the web application, I feel it is adequate to clearly display all of the required information. However, I think in its current state it does not have the level of polish other professional UI’s would have. The only way to fix this problem is by extending the deadline and doing another sprint to polish the UI visuals. Users also pointed out that the history page could be better organised as it can be difficult to see the history of item over its lifetime.

In addition to the key issues identified I have also added an additional feature which may come in handy for any employee doing reports on stocks. I have added a button to export the current list of items to a PDF file which could be useful for official Telesoft records.

If I was to do this project again, I would not change much in how I had conducted the development process from start to finish. However, I would criticize that my initial design does not fully match the final product, for example the Items page being merged into the dashboard and the way items are displayed is a bit different. These changes were made during the implementation phase when I was getting feedback though my agile interviews, this could be considered both a strength and a weakness of agile development. A strength being that I have adapted the final product into something aligning closer to the customer’s needs, however there is some wasted work done earlier in the designing phase. This is just a fact of life in the software development world, it is very unlikely
